Description: This R package is designed for case-control RNA-Seq analysis (two-group). 
  There are six steps: "RNASeqRParam S4 Object Creation", "Environment Setup", "Quality Assessment", 
  "Reads Alignment & Quantification", "Gene-level Differential Analyses" and "Functional Analyses". 
  Each step corresponds to a function in this package. After running functions in order, 
  a basic RNASeq analysis would be done easily.
